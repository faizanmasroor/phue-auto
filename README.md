# NOTE:
This program is not universal and cannot be used by people other than me, as there are no mechanisms to the Hue Bridge or device IP address, or a mechanism to configure which Philips Hue smart lights you would like to connect to.

# Purpose
This program was part of a high school science project, and it connects to my Philips Hue Bridge and turns on the lights if my phone is connected to the home Wi-Fi and turns the lights off it my phone is disconnected.
Beware, this is just a bare-bones script, as latency has not been optimized.
